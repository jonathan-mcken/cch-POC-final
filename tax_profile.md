# Overview

## Problem Statement

A brief description of the problem we're trying to solve. Why is this valuable to work on? 

Formations currently operates with fragmented tax and accounting data across multiple systems, creating significant operational inefficiencies and missed strategic opportunities. Our teams lack a unified view of client tax situations, leading to:

- **Fragmented Client Intelligence**: Teams spend valuable time gathering basic client context before review meetings, requiring extensive institutional knowledge transfer and reducing meeting effectiveness.
- **Limited Strategic Insights**: Without comprehensive historical tax data in one place, we cannot leverage AI to provide meaningful, personalized tax optimization strategies in real-time.
- **Partner Service Limitations**: PRO Partners lack access to comprehensive client tax profiles, limiting their ability to provide sophisticated advisory services and reducing their competitive differentiation.
- **Missed Revenue Opportunities**: Scattered data prevents identification of natural upsell opportunities and strategic service expansions based on client tax evolution over time.
- **Reactive vs. Proactive Service**: Current data structure forces reactive responses to client needs rather than proactive strategy development based on comprehensive tax profile analysis.

This fragmentation prevents Formations from delivering the high-value, AI-powered advisory services that differentiate us in the market and limits our ability to scale sophisticated tax strategies across our client base.

## Proposed Work

A high-level overview of what we're building and why it will solve the problem.

We will build a comprehensive Tax Profile system that serves as the single source of truth for all client tax and accounting data over time. This centralized data architecture will:

1. **Consolidate Multi-Entity, Multi-Year Data**: Create a unified JSON structure containing complete tax history for businesses (1120S/1065) and personal returns (1040) organized by year and entity per Account (post data refactoring term for top level).
2. **Preserve Data**: Store both raw source data (P&L, Balance Sheet) and processed tax return data to maintain historical accuracy regardless of future accounting adjustments.
3. **Enable AI-Powered Insights**: Provide WorkNet AI with comprehensive data access to generate real-time tax optimization strategies and identify planning opportunities, both as upsell opportunities and for our customers to inquire about through chat.
4. **Power Professional Services**: Deliver instant client context for review meetings, eliminating preparation time and knowledge transfer inefficiencies that currently exist.
5. **Enhance Partner Capabilities**: Provide PRO Partners with complete client tax profiles to deliver sophisticated advisory services under their own brand.

### Proposed Data Structure

- **Year-Based Organization**: Each tax year contains complete snapshot of client's tax situation
- **Multi-Entity Support**: Business entities (1120S, 1065) and personal returns (1040) within each year
- **Event Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of taxable events, life changes, and optimization opportunities
- **Historical Preservation**: Immutable record of tax positions and source data as filed

# Success Criteria

What criteria must be met in order to consider this project a success?

- Once this project is complete, **Professional Services teams** will have access to complete client context before any review meeting, which we expect to lead to 50% reduction in meeting preparation time and 30% increase in strategic value delivered per client interaction.
- Once this project is complete, **WorkNet AI** will be able to analyze comprehensive client tax profiles and generate personalized optimization strategies, which we expect to lead to identification of $1M+ in additional tax savings opportunities across our client base annually.
- Once this project is complete, **PRO Partners** will have access to the same comprehensive client intelligence as our internal teams, which we expect to lead to 25% increase in partner revenue through enhanced advisory service capabilities.
- Once this project is complete, **Formations leadership** will have unified client data for strategic analysis and upsell identification, which we expect to lead to 10% increase in revenue per client through targeted service expansion.
